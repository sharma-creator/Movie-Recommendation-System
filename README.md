# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a content-based movie recommendation system that recommends movies to users based on movie features such as genre, director, and cast. The system helps users discover movies that match their interests and preferences.

## About Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **IMDB Movies Dataset**, which contains detailed information about a variety of movies, including their title, genre, director, cast, and ratings. It is a rich source of information that allows us to build movie profiles and recommend similar movies to users based on the content features.

## Overall Analysis and Prediction
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and transformed to extract key features such as genre, director, and cast for each movie.
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Movie similarities were calculated using the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of different movies.
3. **Recommendation**: Based on the calculated similarities, the system recommends movies that are most similar to the ones the user has rated highly or watched.
4. **Evaluation**: The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated based on the relevance of the suggested movies to the users' preferences.

This project demonstrates how a content-based recommendation system can be created using machine learning techniques and movie feature analysis.
